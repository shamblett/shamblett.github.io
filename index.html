    <p> Hi all Dartisans, this my starter site for what will hopefully become a fuller dive into the Dartiverse.</p>
    <p> I'm user <b>'shamblett'</b> in google groups etc, github, medium and on pub where you can find my published packages.</p>
    <p> I've been in the Dartiverse since the start of Dart 1.0, my first published package, xml2json, was back in September 2013.</p>
    <p>I've seen a few changes here and there and picked up a lot of Dart knowledge along the way.</p>
    <p> I mainly stay on the server side of things in the comfort of the VM though I have a few both server and web packages. I've not yet had a look at Flutter,
    mainly because I don't really do web/app development but it is becoming insanely popular so I might one day have a dabble.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The advent of dart 2.6 has really changed the game for me as it brings two things I sorely needed, FFI and Dart2Native.</p>
    <p>My latest package, mraa, couldn't exist without FFI and wouldn't really be deployable without Dart2Native.</p>
    <p>Using these tools I can wrap any native library of my choice and when testing is complete just turn the Dart program into a native exe for deployment to the platform, if
        this isn't a killer feature I don't know what is!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>You can mail me at <b>steve.hamblett@linux.com</b> on any Dart topics excepting flutter for now.</p>
    <p>I have a particular interest in using Dart in the IOT world, a write up for starter project using Google's IOT-Core cloud platform is
        <a href="https://medium.com/@stevehamblett/dart-in-the-iot-world-a-practical-example-601f036212c7">here</a>, however I have many years knowledge of
    software development in high end industrial SCADA and Plant Management and Control systems, interfacing to devices/sensors is
    all part and parcel of this so feel free to ping me ony any questions you may have in this area, Dart related or not.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Happy Darting!</p>
